## Module Renamed To Nuxt Seo Utils

The module has been renamed to `nuxt-seo-utils` to better reflect the functionality it provides.

The original name of the module was `nuxt-seo-experiments`, hinting that the features weren't stable and that they would land in the Nuxt core. This is no longer the case, and the module has been renamed to reflect this.

With this rename the module scope changes to include the random functionality that Nuxt SEO was previously providing:

- `useBreadcrumbItems()` composable
- Config: `redirectToCanonicalSiteUrl`
- Config: `fallbackTitle`
- Config: `automaticDefaults`

The new docs will reflect these.
